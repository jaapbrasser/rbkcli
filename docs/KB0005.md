# KB0005 - Use script template to write your own script.

When adding scripts to rbkcli framework, there are certain requirements that needs to be met.
In order to understand those requirements let's take a look at a simple example:

## DemoScript breakdown:

1. The code:
    The DemoScript is not a great script, but successfully demonstrates that users can freely implement new CLIs, to be used in rbkcli framework, which are not always necessarily related to Rubrik APIs.
    ```python
    """rbkcli demo custom script"""
    
    import subprocess
    from rbkcli import RbkCliBlackOps
    
    class MyOperation(RbkCliBlackOps):
        method = 'get'
        endpoint = '/DemoScript/cmd_passthrough'
        description = 'Rbkcli command that calls local bash commands.'
        summary = 'Call bash commands provided'
        parameters = 'jobId'
        
        def execute(self, args):
            # Check received args:
            print(args)
            
            # Run a call back to rbkcli
            result = self.rbkcli.call_back('cluster me -s id')
            
            # Print call back return
            print(result.text)
            
            # Print received parameter as proxy key:
            print(args.parameters.proxy)
            
            # Call bash command with the provided parameter:
            proxyc_call = subprocess.check_output(str(args.parameters.proxy).split())
            
            # print the result.
            print(proxyc_call.decode("utf-8") )
            
            return "{}"
    ```
2. The base:
    As in any in Python script/module, your first step is to import the necessary packages or Classes from packages:
    ```python
    """rbkcli demo custom script"""
    
    import subprocess
    from rbkcli import RbkCliBlackOps
    ```
    As shown above you can also add a docstring in the first with a short summary explaining the script.
    The class imported from **rbkcli** is called *"RbkCliBlackOps"* and its responsible for integrating the script to the framework.

3. The child class:
    To leverage the *"RbkCliBlackOps"* class you will need to define a child class:
    ```python
    class MyOperation(RbkCliBlackOps):
    ```
    After defining the child class, there are 5 parameters that needs to be defined for the successful import of the script as a CLI. Filling those parameters properly also helps in having a well documented command line.
    ```python
        method = 'get'
        endpoint = '/DemoScript/cmd_passthrough'
        description = 'Rbkcli command that calls local bash commands.'
        summary = 'Call bash commands provided'
        parameters = 'jobId'
    ```
    These parameters will generate the OpenAPI documentation which is the base of any command line interface in **rbkcli**. The most important parameters, which will determine, how will the command be called by user are:
    * endpoint (the actual command line path to be called)
    * method (method to be provided when calling the endpoint, could be one of: get, post, delete, put, patch)
    
    The other parameters are  used to generate accurate documentation.
    
4. The method:
    The method which will be called when user calls the CLI with the script endpoint is **execute**.
    ```python
        def execute(self, args):
            # Check received args:
            print(args)
    ```
    Execute receives one parameter formatted as dictionary, which contains the following contextual data: method called, endpoint called, target of the call, parameters passed, query passed.
    If executed the above code would return the following:
    ```json
    {"method": "get", "target": "192.168.75.200", "parameters": {}, "query": "", "endpoint": "DemoScript/cmd_passthrough"}
    ```
    As the **args** dictionary is a special type of dictionary, its keys can be accessed as Python's objects properties, with a "."(dot):
    ```python
    # Print received parameter as proxy key:
    print(args.parameters.proxy)
    ```
    As parameters should be always provided as json or natural key assignment (json converter), you can also treat expected parameters as properties of parameters, in this case **proxy** is a expected parameter that might not be provided, which will cause a exception.
    
5. The call back:
    Besides the method and arguments provided, the **RbkCliBlackOps** class has a callback object called rbkcli, with a "call_back" method, that allows you to call existing APIs in the same format as the command line:
    ```python
    # Run a call back to rbkcli
    result = self.rbkcli.call_back('cluster me -s id')
    ```
6. The external bits:
    You can also freely perform any actions with other packages outside Rubrik and use that data in the command line being designed:
    ```python
    # Call bash command with the provided parameter:
    proxyc_call = subprocess.check_output(str(args.parameters.proxy).split())

    # print the result.
    print(proxyc_call.decode("utf-8") )
    ```
7. The return:
    You can return any type of data desired, but the rbkcli output module will convert that depending on the format. If the returned data is a list or a dict, it will be printed (by rbkcli framework) as a json which allows the user to leverage json manipulation/conversion arguments.
    If the returned result is empty or a string, the user will have no manipulation over it.
    ```python
    return "{}"
    ```
