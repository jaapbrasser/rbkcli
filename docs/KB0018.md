# KB0018 - Automate Managed Volumes with rbkcli

This is a working demonstration of a **rbkcli SDK** script.

### Scenario
For this scenario let's imagine that:
- You want to Automate the tasks needed to backup a server with Managed Volumes.
- Assume that you know the ID of the Managed Volume you are going to use.

A step by step explanation of the commands used in the script can be found on [Rubrik KB 3527](https://support.rubrik.com/s/article/000003527)

### What can I do?
1. Use a script such as the following.
	```python
	"""Backup MV from client server."""

	import json
	import time
	import sys

	from rbkcli import RbkCli

	def main():
		"""Call rubrik connection and print the output."""
		
		# Treat args provided.
		args = sys.argv[1:]

		# Define the id of the MV.
		mv_id = 'ManagedVolume:::cc04d9e6-9550-48dc-947d-66bf41480cc7'

		# Instantiate using default system auth.
		rbkcli_instance = RbkCli()

		# Create the command to open MV.
		cmd = str('managed_volume ' + mv_id + ' begin_snapshot -m post')

		# Execute the command to Open the MV.
		output = rbkcli_instance.execute(cmd)
		print(output)

		# Define the readiness
		ready = 'False'

		while ready != 'True':
			
			# Create the command to check if it's ready to write.
			cmd = str('managed_volume ' + mv_id + ' -c isWritable -P')

			# Execute the command to check.
			ready = rbkcli_instance.execute(cmd)
			print('Is it ready to write? %s' % ready)

			# Verify if it is writabble
			if ready != 'True':
				print('It is not ready, waiting for 5 secs.')
				time.sleep(5)



		# Create the command to get the channel information.
		cmd = str('managed_volume ' + mv_id + ' -c [mainExport][channels]')

		# Execute the command.
		channels = rbkcli_instance.execute(cmd)
		
		# Load the channels as Python object.
		channels = json.loads(channels)

		# Mount share and back up information.
		# The script can be paused here to do it manually or
		#  call another local script to perform the actions.
		for channel in channels:
			print('The Ip is [%s] and the mount point is [%s]'
				  % (channel['ipAddress'], channel['mountPoint']))

			# Use these 2 vars to mount the share.

			# Use the share mount information to backup the Data.


		# Create the command to open MV.
		cmd = str('managed_volume ' + mv_id + ' end_snapshot -m post')

		# Execute the command to close the MV.
		output = rbkcli_instance.execute(cmd)
		print(output)


	if __name__ == '__main__':
		main()
	```


### Explanation
Starting CDM 5.0+ Managed Volumes integrate with supported Microsoft Windows versions and adds SMB support.
Manage Volumes are network-based (NAS) drives. A Managed Volume can be opened and closed for writes at will using APIs.
In this case we are using rbkcli as a Python module to rely on all API tasks.
The steps related to mount and copy are not described in the script, but can be simply added depending on the OS used.
